        | imagestream      | openshift-jee-sample        |
        | imagestream      | wildfly                     |
        | buildconfig      | openshift-jee-sample        |
        | buildconfig      | openshift-jee-sample-docker |
        | deploymentconfig | openshift-jee-sample        |
        | service          | openshift-jee-sample        |
